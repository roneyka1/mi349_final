                <h2>About the Slap</h2>               
            <p>
                Do you ever wonder what people think about you? Want to hear about your life experiences 
                from another point of view? Need to be uplifted at times when you are down? Want to let your 
                friends know how important they are to you. If you answered yes to any of those questions, The 
                Slap is the place for you. This is a website for you to share stories, random thoughts, kind words and much more
                to those close to you. It's the idea of a blog but instead of blogging about you, you blog 
                about your friends or family, you could even do a coworker if you want!  
            </p>
            <p>Every person has their own way of looking at things. Even when we speak the same language, we can 
                misunderstand each other because we can't see into people's minds. 
                Within a person's own limited perceptions, they may believe they're right/wrong or dumb/smart and so on. 
                This is because all they see is one perspective of themselves, their own. The slap allows one to look at 
                any situation from a wider perspective. Even when two people are right next to each other, how they viewed that 
                moment may sound like two completely different stories. It could snow while you're waiting in a line outside. To 
                you this may be an awful day because you didn't pack warm and don't like getting wet. However, if you asked the 
                person next to you they may say it was the first time they ever saw snow and that day will be a very memorable  day. 
                Each person has a different view on everything, so why not let share those views with others? 
             </p>


                <h2>Getting Started</h2>               
                <p>
                The first thing you need to do, is it create a profile. Once your profile is created, there will 
            automatically be folders put on your page like stories, random thoughts, POV on (your name), etc.
            You can also create your own folders and subfolders. After your page is set up, you can then direct 
            your friends to your page where they may interact with you.  When you post an event on your page, tag 
            whoever was there so they can add their point of view onto the page. You can even tag the location of where you were so other
            people who were there that day can chime in. If those people who aren't tagged want to add their perspective 
            they need to request permission for that specific post. You can choose who you want to view this post when you post it,
            it could be only your friends, your friends that were there that day, or just the friend you post about. After playing 
            around with the website you should be able to understand the basics and begin slapping.</p>

            <p>My name is Kate Roney I am a junior at MSU. I am currently studying computer science.
                I have four siblings, two of which are my triplet siblings.
            </p>
            <p class = "aboutme">INSPIRATION</p>
                <p>         
                My friends and I always love talking about all the fun stuff we've done together. During one of those talks
            everyone had a different perspective of how the night went for them. Each person spent around seven minutes
            talking about their night. When each person told their story, it didn't even feel like we were there too. I thought that was really cool and 
            wanted to start something so more people enjoy hearing other 
            people's views. 
            I also wanted this website to let people share their views on other people. So many times, my friends don't get to see
            all their amazing quality's - inside and out. As the saying goes the hardest person on you, is yourself.
            I always wished they saw themselves the way I viewed them because then 
            I know they wouldn't have any insecurities. I hope this website reminds them of all the great qualities everyone has
            that are sometimes overshadowed by their own thoughts</p>
