                <h2>About the Slap</h2>               
            <p>
                Do you ever wonder what people think about you? Want to hear about your life experiences 
                from another point of view? Need to be uplifted at times when you are down? Want to let your 
                friends how important they are to you? If you answered yes to any of those questions, The 
                Slap is the place for you. This is a website for you to share stories, thoughts, and affirmations
                to those you are closest with. It's close to a blog but instead of blogging about you, you blog 
                about your friends or family, you could even do a coworker if you want! 
            </p>
            <p>Every person has their own way of looking at things. Even when we speak the same language, we can 
                misunderstand each other because we can't see into other people's minds and hearts. 
                Within a person's own limited perceptions, they may believe they're right/wrong or dumb/smart and so on. 
                This is because all they see is one perspective of themselves, their own. The slap allow one to look at 
                any situation from wider perspective. </p>


                <h2>How Slap Works</h2>               
                <p>
                The first thing you need to do it create a profile. Once your profile is creates, there will 
            automatically be folders put on your page like: stories, affirmations, random, thought of you. 
            After your page is set up, you can then direct your friends to your page where they may follow you. 
            You can create your own folders, choose to make a specific folder or post private for you and the 
            friend that posted its eyes. There is also an option to anonymous. After playing around with the 
            website you should be able to understand the basics and begin slapping.</p>

            <p>Let's start with when I was born. First off everyone told my mom to get an abortion because
                I was an accident then even more when they found out I was a triplet. I am so grateful that 
                I am alive today and even more that I get to have now four siblings to live my life with me. My sister was
                told that she was basically dead when she was born and I came out blue and needed a tube stuck in me for a year.
                Both of us made it out and are so happy :) I've had an amzing life since then with a lot of crazy stories </p>

                <p>         
                I went to a private all girls High School that ended up closing down my senior year. It was a joke of a school and
                the amount of hilarious stories I have from this school will make your stomach hurt. We were best friends with our 
                teachers and even better friends with are whole class. It was a class of 37 students so everyone knew everyone and 
                everyone was equal, there was no such thing as popularity, just all being our goofy selves.</p>
