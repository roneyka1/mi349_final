               From looking at the title and photo provided, you may think this will be a short,
                basic story of two friends going to the cider mill, but you should never judge a 
                book by its cover. Like any book, to understand the context you need to hear the
                backstory. It all started August 30th, 2020, the first week of my junior year.
               When I was preparing for school, I started to feel extremely dizzy and unaware of my surroundings,
               after that there was a sharp pain in my head, and I blacked out. On my ride to the hospital, 
               I found out I just had a seizure. After several CT scans and MRI's the doctors told me I had large, 
               benign tumor in my brain that needed to be treated as soon as possible. Although that was scary, 
               this relates to my story because it meant that semester of Junior Year, I would be alone on bed rest.
               The surgery was two weeks later. During that month I felt so isolated  and out of touch with others 
               and myself (couldn't see anyone due to the risk of getting covid). It scared me even more 
               knowing that this was going to be my life for another month. 
            </p>
            <p> Not being able to be with any of my friends for the start of Junior Year made the whole situation really hard on me. 
                I remember Emma texting me and told me she wanted to hang out with me when she came home, I was so excited. My 
                excitement was replaced fast with sadness because I knew I wouldn't be able to see her due to covid.
                She ended up getting covid tested before coming, so she was able to see me when she went home.
                Even though to her it probable didn't mean much, 
                that small act meant so much to me. It was a reminder that I wasn't alone and still had so many
                 people that cared about me. 
            </p>
            <p> We spent a couple hours walking around a small town in Northville and talked like I was never 
                gone. After walking around town, we stopped at a popular cider mill in the area and got cider 
                slushing and donuts. The view was amazing, and the food was even better. She is one of my closest 
                friends, and with Emma Toppi, there is never a dull moment when she is around. I don't remember 
                what we talked about much. I know there was some gossip about a certain boy but besides that
                I know it was a lot of fun. After a month of being alone, I finally felt like 
                myself again. This was the first time after my seizure, I knew that everything was going to be okay. 
                In just three hours, Emma Toppi was able to brighten my mood for the whole month!
